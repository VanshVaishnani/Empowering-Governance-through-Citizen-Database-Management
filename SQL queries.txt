6. To project population growth over the next 5 years, we need to make some assumptions and acknowledge the limitations of the current schema.

Limitations:
1.  The current schema does not contain historical population data.
2.  It lacks data on migration (both into and out of states).
3.  It doesn't have fertility rates or age-specific mortality rates, which are crucial for accurate projections.

Assumptions (for a simplified projection):
1.  We'll assume a uniform population growth rate across all states. This is a *very* simplified assumption. In reality, growth rates vary significantly.
2.  We'll calculate the growth rate based on the existing citizen data as a proxy. This is also a simplification.
3.  We'll ignore migration, which is a major factor in population change.
4.  Since we don't have age-specific rates, we'll apply the overall growth rate to the entire population.
